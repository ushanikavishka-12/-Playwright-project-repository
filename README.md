- Robustness testing using incorrect, mixed, or unusual inputs
- UI-related functional testing for real-time output updates
- Automation of all test cases using Playwright

### Excluded
- Backend API testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing

## Test Case Coverage
Automated tests are derived from the Excel test cases prepared using the template provided in
Appendix 2 of the assignment specification.

Coverage includes:
- Simple, compound, and complex sentences
